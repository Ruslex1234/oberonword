## What is this?

**OberonWord** is a simple static site (HTML/CSS/JS) hosted on GitHub Pages. It presents curated, game-ready text blocks you can copy with one click. The repo is intentionally minimal so it loads fast in a browser overlay or side monitor.

This was a **very popular page in its first year** of use. Over time, players found workarounds to copy/paste text faster on Oberon, and the **Action Bar** also became a reliable way to send the same messages in-game. Even so, OberonWord remains useful for players who prefer a lightweight external helper.
